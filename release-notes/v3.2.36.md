AuroraMusic v3.2.36
====================

Release Date: 2025-10-14

Summary
-------
Add automated custom release body generation to workflow (changelog + recent commits + docker image section). Version bump only; no runtime code changes besides version metadata.

Changes
-------
### Added
- Release workflow step to build a rich GitHub Release body (aggregates matching release-notes file, last 15 commits, image tags, expected platforms).

### Changed
- Version bumped to 3.2.36 in configuration, README, and admin fallback.

### Technical Notes
- `generate_release_notes` disabled in favor of curated `body_path` content.
- Existing multi-arch build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) unchanged.
