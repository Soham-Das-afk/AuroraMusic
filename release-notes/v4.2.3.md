This release focuses on enhancing the user experience with improved audio quality, more robust error handling, and several new features requested by the community.

**✨ New Features**

*   **Upgraded Audio Engine**: The audio processing pipeline has been completely revamped, now leveraging `discord.py`'s `FFmpegOpusAudio` for superior audio quality and performance. This change reduces CPU load and provides a smoother listening experience.
*   **Interactive "Now Playing" Panel**: The bot now shows a dynamic "Now Playing" message that updates in real-time, reducing channel spam and providing a cleaner interface.

**🚀 Enhancements**

*   **Faster Track Loading**: Improvements in track metadata fetching have significantly reduced the time it takes to load songs and playlists.
*   **Improved Autoplay**: The autoplay algorithm is now more intelligent, selecting more relevant tracks based on the listening history of the channel.
*   **UI Polish**: The controller and welcome banner have received minor visual tweaks for a more polished and modern look.

**🐛 Bug Fixes**

*   Fixed a bug where the queue would not advance properly after a track failed to play.
*   Resolved an issue where the bot would sometimes fail to join a voice channel.
*   Corrected a rare condition that could cause the bot to become unresponsive.

**🔧 Technical Changes**

*   The project now uses multi-architecture Docker builds, supporting `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/arm/v7`.
*   CI/CD workflows have been updated for better reliability and faster builds.
