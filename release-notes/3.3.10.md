### Version 3.3.10

This update focuses on major refactoring, bug fixes, and code cleanup for improved stability and maintainability.

**✨ New Features & Improvements**
- Implemented a centralized, file-based logging system to `logs/bot.log`.
- Re-architected the music player, separating logic into dedicated managers for playback, queue, and controller UI.

**🐛 Bug Fixes**
- Corrected the `previous` button functionality to reliably play the actual last song.
- Fixed state management issues with the `skip` button, ensuring smooth transitions for both manual skips and auto-advancing tracks.
- Resolved race conditions in the music controller, preventing UI update failures.
- Addressed inefficiencies in Spotify playlist processing.

**🧹 Housekeeping**
- Removed all `print`, `traceback`, and `logging.debug` statements from the codebase.
- Deleted one-time utility scripts from the `scripts` directory.
- Standardized exception handling across the project.
