AuroraMusic v3.2.31

Highlights
- Logging cleanup: replaced remaining print statements with structured logging across Spotify source, playback, and music cog for quieter, consistent logs.
- Type annotations: aligned abstract base signatures to match real return types, resolving override/typecheck noise.
- Docs: README version references updated to v3.2.31.
- CI: Added GitHub Actions workflow to build/push Docker images and create GitHub Releases on tags.
