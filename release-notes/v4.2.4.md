### Version 4.2.5 (2026-03-04)

This release introduces playlist management, improved playback controls, and expanded platform support, along with several key bug fixes and performance enhancements.

**✨ New Features**

*   **Playlist Management**: You can now create, delete, and manage your own playlists directly within the bot. Use the new playlist commands to add or remove tracks, and save your favorite queues for later.

*   Patched a memory leak that could occur when queuing a large number of tracks.

**🔧 Technical Changes**
