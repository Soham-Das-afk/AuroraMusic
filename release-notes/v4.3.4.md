### Version 4.3.4 (2026-02-08)

**✨ Enhancements**

*   **Proxy Support**: Added comprehensive proxy configuration via `PROXY_URL` environment variable and `valid_proxies.txt` file support. This allows for more reliable YouTube access in restricted network environments.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Reduced queue processing delay from 1s to 0.1s for significantly faster responsiveness when adding songs.

**🐛 Bug Fixes**

*   **Stability**: Increased Spotify-to-YouTube conversion timeout to better handle slower connections and proxies.

**🔧 Technical Changes**

*   Integrated proxy usage directly into YouTube search, streaming, and playlist extraction logic.
*   Passed proxy settings to FFmpeg to ensure reliable playback streams.
*   Added `update_current_song` helper to `MusicQueue`.
*   Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude `.cache` and `logs/` from version control.
