### Version 4.3.1 (2026-02-06)

This is a release focused on simplifying the user interface, fixing critical bugs, and improving overall stability.

**✨ Enhancements**

*   **Simplified Music Controller**: The music controller UI has been streamlined by removing the "Rewind," "Forward," and "Volume" buttons. This provides a cleaner and more focused user experience.

**🐛 Bug Fixes**

*   **`cleanup` Command Fixed**: Resolved a critical bug where the `/cleanup` slash command would result in an "Unknown Integration" error, making it unusable. A legacy prefix-based `!cleanup` command has also been re-introduced as a fallback to ensure administrators can always manage the bot's controller channel.
*   **Resolved Startup Errors**: Fixed multiple `ImportError` exceptions that were preventing the bot from loading its music and admin cogs correctly. This was caused by residual code from the removed volume features.

**🔧 Technical Changes**

*   Refactored the controller embed and button view layouts to reflect the removed features.
*   Removed dead code related to the volume, rewind, and forward functionality from the `music`, `admin`, and `handlers` modules.
